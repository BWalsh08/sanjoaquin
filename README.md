 San Joaquin Valley Town Hall

These are the starter files needed to complete the San Joaquin Valley Town Hall website for homework. 

We will be doing several assignments for this site over the next few weeks. Each assignment will add new content, formatting, and functoinality to the site.

You will create a "Fork" of this project to your own Github account, and you will send all updates for this project to the one repository. 

# Be sure to update the "About" area to display the link to your live site
